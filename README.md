Design (?) Project: 

Originally, I was planning on reimagining Spotify's Investors Relations website as a "What if Spotify's website looked like the Apple website?". However, I went on a bit of a tangent.

Personally, I absolutely love Spotify, and I felt that the Investors Relations website wasn't the best. However, while looking through the website, I saw their shareholder's report and thought that it would be cool to display it in their iconic "Spotify Wrapped" format.

Prior to this, I've never seriously used Figma to design myself, but for some reason, I started off making one slide, then another, and I ended up creating the whole thing. 

This was a super fun project! Prior to this project, I considered becoming an actuary, because I always said that I loved numbers. However, I realize that I love having a creative outlet on the side. Anyways! Here's the project... displayed in Apple's website style. 

It's not complete, so bear with me! I promise it'll be better!
